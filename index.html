    <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2005/jon-kleinberg">MacArthur Foundation Fellowship,</a> a <a href="https://www.packard.org/approach/fellowships-for-science-engineering/">Packard Foundation Fellowship,</a> a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur and Simons Foundations, and the AFOSR, ARO, and NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.</p>

    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Since Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I have been teaching a course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>
      <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</em></li>
          <li> <em>There is an on-line edX course based on the book: Networks, Crowds, and Markets, taught jointly with David Easley and Eva Tardos.</em> </li>
        </ul>

      <li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley, 2005</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <em>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.</em> </li>
        </ul>

      <li>I teach a PhD-level course on network models, entitled The Structure of Information Networks (CS 6850).</li>
